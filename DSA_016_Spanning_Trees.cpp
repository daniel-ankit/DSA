/*  THEORY

SUBGRAPH : A subgraph S of graph G is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the original graphn G.
CONNECTED GRAPH : Graph that is connected in the sense of a topological space.
COMPLETE GRAPH : Undirected Graph in which every pair of distinct vertices are connected.

SPANNING TREE : A connected Subgraph S og graph G is said to be spanning tree if
    - All vertices are present in the subgraph
    - Number of edges = Number of vertices - 1
    - Total Number of Spanning trees for a graph : n⁽ⁿ⁻²⁾.
