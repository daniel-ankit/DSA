## My Dynamic Programming Journey

Will be adding all the codes I wrote while learning Dynamic Programming.

Resources I used:

[MIT Opencourse Ware - 6.006 Algorithms, Spring Semester](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZES21J5RvsHOeSW9Vrvo0EEc2juNe3tX) <br />
[Aditya Verma - Dynamic Programming Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWekqhdCPmFohncHwz8TY2Go)


## What is Dynamic Programming ?
##### Dynamic Programming is an enhanced recursion.
### How to know which question will be solved by Dynamic Programming ?
##### DP will be applied to a question 
1. You're allowed to choose weather to include some items or not.
2. If you're asked to find optimal values like minimum, maximum, largest, smallest etc.

## Types of Problems in Dynamic Programming and their variations
* 0/1 Knapsack problem [6]
* Unbounded Knapsack [5]
* Fibonacci [7]
* LCS [15]
* LIS [10]
* Kadane's Algorithm [6]
* Matrix Chain Multiplication [7]
* Dynamic Programming on Trees [4]
* Dynamic Programming on Grid [14]
* Others [5]
