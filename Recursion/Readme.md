## Recursion

### What is Recursion? 
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.
Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.

### Problems for Practice :
[Print numbers from 1 to n without any Loops](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-will-you-print-numbers-from-1-to-200-without-using-loop/) <br />
[Maximum Depth of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/) <br />
[Sort a Stack using recursion]() <br />

### Where to go next?
* Greedy Algorithms
* Backtracking
* Dynamic Programming
