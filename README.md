### Data Structures and Algorithms

A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.<br /><br />
This repository contains detailed codes on different data structures (DS) with thier implementation from scratch. I've tried to write codes that will be easier to understand.<br />
The different Data Structures we'll be studing about are:
* Array
* Linked List
  * Singly Linked List
  * Doubly Linked List
* Stack
  * Implementation using Arrays
  * Implementation using Linked List
* Queue
  * Implementation using Arrays
  * Implementation using Linked List
* Double-Ended Queue (DEQueue)
* Binary Tree
  * Implementation using Arrays
  * Implementation using Doubly Linked List
* Binary Search Tree
* AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) Tree
* Heap
  * Binary Tree Implementation
  * Array Implementation
* Graph
  * Adjacency List
  * Adjacency Matrix 
  * Edge Set
  * Compact List representation
* Spanning Trees
