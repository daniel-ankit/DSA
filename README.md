### Data Structures and Algorithms

A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.<br />
This repository contains detailed codes on different data structures (DS) with thier implementation from scratch. I've tried to write codes that will be easier to understand.<br />
So, get a snack, settle in. I'm going to show you how my Data Structure journey was.<br />
